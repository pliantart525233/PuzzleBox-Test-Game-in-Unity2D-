# PuzzleBox(Test Game on Unity 2D)
 A game I did in unity 2D just for fun

To run it, just run the .exe file (It is named "Small puzzle game"). 

I warn you that the game is not nearly in a finished state and I will not continue developing it, so there are bugs, and they will not be patched (it is still easily playable, and you will probably not have any issues)

The game was made using version 2020.3.15f2 (LTS)
